# Use source code

If you want to change the source code, you can clone the repository and install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SCMeTA/SCMeTA.git

```

Then, you can install it with poetry.
Note that you should install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) first.

```bash
cd SCMeTA
poetry install
```
