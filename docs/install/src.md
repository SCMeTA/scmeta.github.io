# Use source code

If you want to change the source code, you can clone the repository and install.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SCMeTA/SCMeTA.git

```

Then, you can install it with pip or poetry.

```bash
cd SCMeTA
pip install .

## or use poetry
poetry install

```

Or you can directly use the source code. Create a python or Jupyter notebook in the root directory of the repository, and import the package.

```python
from SCMeTA import Process

```

More details can be found in [Using SCMeTA](../quick-start)
