## Description

The `filter_occ` method will filter the data based on the occurrence of the data. The data will be filtered based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data. The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set. The data will be filtered based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data. The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set. The data will be filtered based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data. The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set. The data will be filtered based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data. The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set.

The data will be filtered based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data. The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set.

## Parameters

- **count**: `int` Minimum number of occurrence to be considered.
- **resolution**: `float` Minimum resolution of the data, default is 0.1.
- **file_name**: `str` The name of the `SCData` to be processed, default is `None`.

## Example Usage

```python

scmeta.filter_occ(count=10, resolution=0.1, file_name='HeLa')
```

TODO: add example

## Output

The `filter_occ` method will generate a new `SCData` object, and the `SCData` object will be saved in the `data` directory.
