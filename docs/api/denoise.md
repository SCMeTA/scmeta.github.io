The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set. The data will be denoised based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data. The minimum number of occurrence is the minimum number of occurrence of the data in the data set. The minimum resolution is the minimum resolution of the data in the data set. The data will be denoised based on the minimum number of occurrence and the minimum resolution of the data.
